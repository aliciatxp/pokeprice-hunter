# Pokeprice Hunter

Web scraper for tracking Japanese PokÃ©mon card prices from Torecacamp!  
Personal project because I wanted to make a more informed decision whenever I buy new cards for my collection ðŸ˜†

### Current Features

- Scrapes around 25,000 PokÃ©mon card prices (from Scarlet & Violet back to LEGEND - expansion packs only!)
- (Attempt at) cleaning the data (Formats vary by a lot!)
- Support for both GUI and headless operation

## Data Structure

- **Card Name**: Full card name in Japanese
- **Condition**: Card condition (A, B, C, with + or -)
- **Set**: Card set code (e.g., SV10, SM8b)
- **Card Number**: Numbering within the set (e.g., 130/098)
- **Price**: Pice in Japanese Yen (Â¥)

## Future Plans (hopefully)
- Retrieve PROMO and vintage card data
- Price trend visualizations
